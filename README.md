### Developer. Podcaster. Nerd.

Iâ€™m a frontend developer, specializing in complex UI for web apps.

* I think RSS is important, so I built an RSS reader app: **[RSS is Awesome](https://rssisawesome.com)**.
* I think static sites are important, so I buit an ESM-first static site generator: **[JS.SSG](https://jsssg.org)**.
* I think being able to style *everything* with CSS is important, so I made a styleable audio player: **[Picobel](https://github.com/tomhazledine/picobel)**.

I tinker with all sorts of things but my current interests are data-visualisation, web-audio, and modular synthesis. I enjoy building funny little interactive charts, and I cling onto my music-tech roots by creating FX modules and instruments that exist solely in-browser.
